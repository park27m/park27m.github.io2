<h2>About the creator</h2>
<h3>
    This website was designed by a student who could not foster her own dog. This withdrawl from the best friend of mankind has caused chaos to enter her life. She has created this website as a lifeline for other students in her position. Although the lack of animal affection remains. This is the closest thing that can be created.

    This page allows for posts about personal puppies owned and missed (it does not but the thought is what counts)
